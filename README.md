# BC Fish Passage web mapping

A basic web map for displaying data created by [bcfishpass](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass)


This development repo is a mirror of https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/bcfishpass/tree/gh-pages-al.  The origin repo was generated from a clone of the defunct `bcfishpass-web` from Simon Norris (Hillcrest Geographics).  From there a fetch of https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/bcfishpass/tree/gh-pages-al was made to bring in custom updates made to https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/tree/main/app.  
  
  

Plan for now is to track development at https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/bcfishpass/tree/gh-pages-al and hopefully collaborate on overall development of https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/tree/main/app. 
  
  

## Historic Development of bcfishpass-web

- create views as necessary in `sql`
- add layers/modify styling in `style.json` as required
- `serve` and view on `localhost:3000`
